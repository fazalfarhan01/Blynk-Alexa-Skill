## 2. Next Step - Code
1. Clone this repo.
2. Modify [lambda/config.json](lambda/config.json) accordingly.
2. Create a Pithon Virtual Environment.
3. Install all the dependencies from [requirements.txt](lambda/requirements.txt)
4. Copy all the files from site-packages to lambda folder.

## 3. Next we setup VS Code
AWS-CLI can also be used but I prefer VS Code.

1. Install VS Code.
2. Install [Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ask-toolkit.alexa-skills-kit-toolkit).
3. Open the extension and login with the same credentials as before.
4. Click on download and edit skill from side bar.

6. Wait for it to complete the cloning.
7. Copy all the files in the lambda folder in the GitHub cloned repo to ASK cloned repo.
8. Commit the changes. Sync the changes. Wait for some time and then deploy from the VS Code plugin.

## 4. Enabling the Beta Testing
1. Fill in all the details in __Distribution__.
2. Then jump to __Certification__ and __Run Validation__, rectify errors if any. (It's only after this step that you can enable beta testing.)
